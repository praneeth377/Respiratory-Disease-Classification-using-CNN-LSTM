# Respiratory Disease Classification using CNN-LSTM Hybrid Model

During our Post Graduation final Capstone project, our team focused on developing a robust CNN-LSTM model tailored for classifying audio files into various respiratory diseases. These diseases encompass COPD, Bronchiectasis, Asthma, upper and lower respiratory tract infections, Pneumonia, and Bronchiolitis. Our project journey involved a comprehensive approach, starting from feature extraction and preprocessing of audio files to handling class imbalance and implementing machine learning ensemble techniques such as Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and XG Boost. Transitioning to deep learning, we explored models like 1D CNN, LSTM, and our primary focus, the CNN-LSTM architecture. Each model underwent meticulous optimization and parameter tuning using GridSearchCV, ensuring optimal performance.

The culmination of our efforts resulted in a final model that consistently achieved accuracy levels exceeding 90%. This exceptional performance positions our model as an invaluable tool for medical professionals, serving as a reliable preliminary diagnostic aid in identifying respiratory conditions. By leveraging advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, our project underscores the potential of technology in enhancing healthcare outcomes and facilitating timely interventions for patients.
